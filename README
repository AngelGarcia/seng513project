Dispatcher Info
*************************************************************
The dispatcher determines the required action based on the URL. Routes are defined
in /lib/routes.js.

Note that only files in /public are available to the outside world.

Please see /lib/routes.js for examples on how to register routes. Essentially, it 
is as simple as adding a new 'r.add' line under the existing routes. Notice that
you should omit the '/public' from the path when defining routes to static files.
